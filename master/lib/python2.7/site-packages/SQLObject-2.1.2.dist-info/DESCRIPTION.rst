SQLObject is a popular *Object Relational Manager* for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.

SQLObject includes a Python-object-based query language that makes SQL
more abstract, and provides substantial database independence for
applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB (SAPDB).
Python 2.6 or 2.7 is required.

For development see the projects at
`SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlobject/>`_
and `GitHub <https://github.com/sqlobject>`_.
