    "### We have a dataset (in the data folder) which contains sms messages, with a classification for each into spam or \"ham\". First, explore the dataset using pandas, and come up with a metric for the 'spamminess' of individual words. One example is the ratio of the # of times a word appears in the spam set vs the # of times it appears in the 'ham' set\n",

    "### Lastly, break up the dataset into testing and training, and see what else you can do (perhaps with the vectorizer or classifier parameters) to improve the performance - using the f1 score"
